# Vision-based-Nonlinear-Control-for-UAVs
Vision-based Nonlinear UAV Control with Real-time Obstacle Avoidance using PX4, ROS, Lyapunov and Control Barrier Functions(CBF).

This project has implemented an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Control and obstacle avoidance system based on PX4 + ROS, integrating nonlinear Lyapunov control and Control Barrier Function (CBF), and supporting a smooth migration from simulation to the actual aircraft. The system operates in map-free, depth-only and real-time scenarios, and has robustness and real-time performance.
